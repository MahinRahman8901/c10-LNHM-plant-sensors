# c10-LNHM-plant-sensors
LNMH has an array of sensors (see more) setup to monitor the health of a plant but they are currently only configured with a single, simple API endpoint that reports the current health of a plant. The museum wants to be able to monitor the health of the plants over time and to be able to alert the gardeners when there is a problem.
